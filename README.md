# Automated-Face-recgonition-DetectAttend:
### Face Recognition Attendence System
created a real-time Face Detect system. Added a graphical interface along with a live database to create a real-world system. 

### Setup the Webcam:
Configure the webcam to capture the live video feed.
Ensure the camera settings are optimized for clear facial recognition.

### Setup the Graphical Interface:
Design and implement an elegant graphical user interface (GUI) for better user experience.
Integrate the GUI with the system to display the live video feed and attendance status.

### Encoding Generator:
Utilize the face recognition library to encode facial features.
Use 128 facial parameters to generate unique facial encodings for accurate identification.

### Database Setup:
Set up a robust database to store student data and images.
Use Firebase for efficient and real-time data storage and retrieval.

### Attendance Marking Logic:
Check if the user has already given attendance:
If yes, display "Presence already marked."
If no, mark the Presence and update the database.

Implement a validation mechanism to ensure unregistered persons cannot mark attendance.
